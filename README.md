# FUSEE_SUITE_TESTING_EXPERIMENTS

NOTHING TO SEE HERE

Initially just a clone of other repo. Different part 1 and 2 in testing stage will be here. Will probably be attacking the Tegra crystal at some point later(when I get  a patched unit)

Standard disclaimer:

Flash at own risk. You might need an external flasher to get you out the sh.t if I forget something. The worse that can happen is that your Switch fuses will be burnt (if you are saving them for whatever reason. No need. Just BURN the f...ers and enjoy dual boot.) and you might need to reflash the SAMD21 chip using a Raspberry Pi.
